# OPENCV_Color_Classifier
This is an opencv program, that allows you to filter any color. Change the RGB values to other ones(to this day, I still do not know why it says it works in HSV even though the values in RGB work)

In this case, it is set to cyan, and when it finds it, it surrounds it in a box, and executes an external python file. Use this as a template if you wish!

The code is also commented :)
